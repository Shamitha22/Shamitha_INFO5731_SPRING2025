        "A Python inventory management system performs several key functions like adding, deleting, updating, and searching for products. Data is often stored in files such as CSVs or databases. The program ensures data integrity by checking for duplicate product IDs before adding a new product. It handles invalid data, such as non-numeric quantities or prices, by prompting the user for corrections. If the file is corrupted or missing, it gracefully handles errors, either by notifying the user or creating a new file. Additionally, the system generates reports that show total inventory value and category breakdowns, providing insights into inventory health.\n",
